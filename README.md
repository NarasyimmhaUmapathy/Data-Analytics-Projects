# Data-Analytics-Projects

This is my repository of self learning data analytics and data science projects. I have taken several courses online to help me understand these concepts and tools better

Some of the projects I have worked on are on classification, regression, clustering and time series forecasting. I have used both Python and PySpark.

I am not a computer science student so alot of this things are new to me, if the code is not perfect, just know that I am still learning.
